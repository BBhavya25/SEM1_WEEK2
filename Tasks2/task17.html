    <h1>The Talking Dog for Sale</h1>
    <p>
      A man sees an ad in the local newspaper: "Talking Dog for Sale - $50!"
      Intrigued, he calls the number and visits the house. He asks the owner,
      "Is it true? You have a talking dog?" "Sure do," says the owner. "He's out
      back." The man walks out to the backyard and sees an ordinary-looking dog
      just sitting there. Curious, he asks, "Can you talk?" "Yep," says the dog.
      "Sure can." The man is amazed. "So, what's your story?" The dog looks up
      and begins to speak. "Well, I discovered my ability to talk when I was
      just a pup. I wanted to help, so I offered my services to the government.
      They had me working all over the world. I've spied on criminals, overheard
      secret meetingsâ€”you name it, I've done it. After a few years, I got tired
      of the spy game, so I retired. Now I just relax and enjoy my life." The
      man is completely blown away. He rushes back to the owner and asks, "Why
      on earth are you selling this amazing dog for just $50?" The owner shrugs
      and says, "Because he's a liar! He hasn't done any of that stuff!"
